# react-native-auth-firebase
An simple react-native app with firebase auth function.

This app is an example while [taking course on Udemy starting from lecture 59](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/learn/v4/t/lecture/5744158). 
It's a bit of different from original lecture's material with some of my own modifications.
